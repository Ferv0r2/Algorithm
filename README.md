### Week 1
    : Understanding Time, Space Complexity & Get the most alphabets

- Time complexity is more important than space complexity.

- Time complexity should always be expressed in the worst case scenario.

- Time complexity uses notation such as O(n)

- The ord() is a method that replaces the value of the ASCII code.

### Week 2
    : Learn the definition of a Class, Linked-List, Recursive function & Binary Search

- The difference between array and Linked-list

- Good data structure is different for each inquiry, insertion, and deletion.

- How to use the recursive function.

- How to code more efficiently

---

### Week 3
    : Learn the types of alignments and algorithm implementation & Implement various data structures ( Stack, Queue )

- bubble_sort -> O(n^2), selection_sort -> O(n^2), insertion_sort  -> Best - O(n), Worst - O(n^2)

- merge_sort -> Very Hard, Use Recursive function, Slicing array ★★★★★ -> O(n log n)

- Stack -> LastInFirstOut (LIFO) | push(data) | pop() | peek() | isEmpty()

- Queue -> FirstInFirstOut (FIFO) | enqueue(data) | dequeue() | peek() | isEmpty()

- Hash -> {key:value}, hash(data) |
